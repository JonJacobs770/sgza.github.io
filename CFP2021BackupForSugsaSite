Numerous instances of the Regional Scrum Gathering®, supported by Scrum Alliance, take place around the Globe every year. South Africa’s event has been running for ten years. It enjoys a reputation for being an excellent opportunity to learn and to connect with the local Agile and Scrum community; making it a popular, highly anticipated event in the calendar.
We are currently looking for speakers to present talks and workshops that embrace simplicity in our community of Agilists.
All accepted speakers and co-speakers will be eligible for a ticket to attend the full conference. We have a generous travel and accommodation policy, detailed in our Speaker Terms and Conditions below.
Please ensure that you have familiarised yourself with the Code of Conduct and the Speaker T&amp;Cs before you make a submission. By making a submission into the SGZA 2021 system, you’re declaring that you have full knowledge of the content in both:

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Call for Papers - Embracing Simplicity</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world in which complexity seems to be rapidly increasing, how do we embrace simplicity and effectively maximize the amount of work not done in our approaches?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we’re looking for perspectives and insights that embrace the avoidance of waste and reduce overt complexity to achieve ultimate sophistication.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’d like to explore opposing positions, discover unexpected views and leave with a slightly more open, inclusive view of the world.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There is so much knowledge and wisdom in our community - we’re looking for speakers and attendees that will help us to create a conference which not only creates a safe space to learn but deep dives into what it means to embrace simplicity as an Agilist.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We value:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New ideas </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">over</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> old content</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specific opinion </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">over</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> one-size-fits-all</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Own experiences from the field </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">over</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> theory</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive sessions </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">over</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sit-and-listen (but there’s room for both)</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to be sure:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your proposal supports our theme – Embracing Simplicity – and that it contributes depth (or breadth) to the community’s discussions</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can comfortably deliver what you’re proposing, regardless of whether you are well known or a first-timer on the conference speaking scene</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People will be excited and intrigued to attend your session</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">People will get something of value from the time spent in your session</span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">You don’t need to achieve </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">all</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the points above, but if you don’t hit at least a few of them, you need to give it more thought.</span>
<h3><b>How to get rejected:</b></h3>
<ul>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include a same-old, same-old topic or approach (unless there’s a new twist or a truly deep experience base)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include thinly-veiled (or unveiled) marketing or promotion of services</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your submission’s golden thread and “Why?” are difficult to follow or understand</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It does not appear that an adequate level of effort was involved in your submission</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Include specific personally-identifying information (name, company you work for) in the body of the submission – please </span><b>do not </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">do this – we follow a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">blind</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> review and selection process (we hide names of people submitting in the system, so that the selection process is free from bias)</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your submission doesn’t address any of the topic tracks outlined below</span></li>

 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What does embracing the Agile Principle of maximising the amount of work not done, mean to you?</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Additional Information  </b></h2>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(guidance for submitting a session)</span></i>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A workshop versus a talk</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A good guideline for a workshop is that the time you will be speaking needs to be 40% or less of the total session time, with the remainder of the time to be used for participant activities (doing an exercise or activity or interacting with other attendees). Workshops are typically 90 mins in length with talks being 45mins.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We pride ourselves on hosting a conference where all speakers respect each other, and the audience, allowing us to run on schedule.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lightning talk </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lightning talk is short and punchy - just 15 minutes - including a quick intro from the room’s facilitator and any Q&amp;A.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lightning talk doesn’t need to offer a solution, it can be designed to start a conversation, spark ideas and get people thinking or it could be sharing something interesting you’ve experienced.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equipment available</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Each room is equipped with a projector, a flipchart with markers, sticky notes and pens. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The rooms are generally laid out with tables and chairs in banquet style.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you require any specialised items or room settings, please list these in the </span><b>‘notes’</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section of Sessionize and we will try to accommodate you. We cannot guarantee this, so we will remain in contact with you while managing logistics.</span>
